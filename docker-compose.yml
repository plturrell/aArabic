# Master Docker Compose File
# This is the main entry point for starting all services
# All compose files are organized in docker/compose/
version: '3.8'

# This file includes all other compose files for easy orchestration
# Usage:
#   docker-compose up -d                    # Start all services
#   docker-compose -f docker/compose/core.yml up -d  # Start specific services

# To start all services, use this command from project root:
# docker-compose \
#   -f docker/compose/docker-compose.core.yml \
#   -f docker/compose/docker-compose.qdrant.yml \
#   -f docker/compose/docker-compose.embedding.yml \
#   -f docker/compose/docker-compose.markitdown.yml \
#   up -d
