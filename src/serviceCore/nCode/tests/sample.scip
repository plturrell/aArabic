# Sample SCIP Index File for Testing
#
# This is a placeholder file. SCIP (Sourcegraph Code Intelligence Protocol) files
# are binary protobuf-encoded files that cannot be easily hand-created.
#
# To generate a real SCIP file for testing:
#
# 1. Install scip-cli or a language indexer:
#    - For TypeScript: npm install -g @sourcegraph/scip-typescript
#    - For Python: pip install scip-python
#    - For Go: go install github.com/sourcegraph/scip-go@latest
#
# 2. Index a sample project:
#    scip-typescript index --output sample.scip
#
# 3. Or use the scip CLI tool:
#    scip snapshot sample.scip
#
# For now, this file serves as a stub that the test server accepts.
# The actual SCIP parsing happens in scip_reader.zig.
