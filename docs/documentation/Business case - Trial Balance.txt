Month End Controls – Trial Balance

Version: 1.0






















Executive Summary

Trial Balance review is conducted during M+1 to M+7 across all Legal entities, Segment & Group, to understand the variance & balance movements between periods. Deep dives to assess the events, transactions causing the variances and reasons behind them. Analysed with detailed commentaries for these movements are prepared & submitted to Group for further review & used for Country CFO packs/Legal entity reporting.

Downloading Trail balance from PSGL/S4 & preparing the detailed analysis across all 234 LEs are highly time consuming, current view is at Legal entity level and need to be in Finance caption level & segment level. Considerable time spent during month end close days and limiting the time for deep dives & detailed analysis

An AI model produces business insights and written commentaries (Finance reporting caption Level & Segment Level with Legal entity view) based on the analysis performed on general ledger transaction data that detects anomalies, trends, unusual movements, new accounts, spikes/drops vs prior periods, and material balances. GCFO teams get a narrative summary instead of just numbers, accelerating review and improving decision-making. Template should have multiple user access for further inputs/review.

At least 20 to 25 FTEs spent on an average 4 hrs a day during M-2 to M+5, which is equivalent to ~5 FTE saves, with strengthening controls by eliminating manual process and reducing the overall book close timelines enabling Fast close.

AI Architect & AI Engineer from SCB AI Studios required to spent <100 days to build this AI model, along with GPM, Process lead, SME & PPE lead for at least 10 to 15 days equivalent efforts for Business Requirements, designing process models, validating the solutions created and perform testing to confirm results.

Recommended to proceed with Studio AI solutions which is inhouse and cost & timelines are minimal.

Problem/Opportunity statement

Current state: 
Trial Balance variance analysis with commentaries for 234 LEs, Segments & Group is performed during M+1 to M+7 days & shared with Group team for review. (Refer ARIS process map for detailed steps)
Currently it is only with reporting dimension of Legal Entity and team manually prepares Finance caption level reporting which takes considerable time on data extraction & preparation of reports rather than Analysis & insightful commentaries
Over all delays in reporting process to Group as well as Countries
Current state is not ready for moving into daily controls

Business impact: 
20 to 25 FTEs manual efforts reduction in Trial Balance preparation & review during M+1 to M+7
Hurdle to achieve overall reporting timelines
Manual process leading to EUCs & related maintenance; manual handoffs leading to continuous monitoring of controls, enhanced automated controls from UK ACG perspective
Foundation for future daily-control operating model, enabling real-time financial insight.

Drivers for Change:
In house AI solutions
AI teams availability
Solution feasibility 
Deployment timelines &
No/minimal additional cost for AI solutions & maintenance (esp. no cost for LLM, Tokens, AI team)

Project Description

Proposed Solution: 
An AI model produces business insights and written commentaries in the trial balance review views based on the analysis performed on general ledger transaction data that detects anomalies, trends, unusual movements, new accounts, spikes/drops vs prior periods, and material balances. GCFO teams get a narrative summary instead of just numbers, accelerating review and improving decision-making.


Project Objectives
Optimisation of process to improve the process maturity levels
E2E process automation including commentary writing
Building block to create SCB Finance LLM

Scope 
In scope – Trial balance review at caption level, variance analysis & commentary writing
Out of scope – Country IFRS reporting, BSS Risk assessment

Key deliverables
AI automation on Trial balance process
